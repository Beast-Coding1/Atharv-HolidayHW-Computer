 <h1><u>About Us</u></h1>
 <h2>Our Story</h2>
 <pre>
 Our story began in 2000 when we opened our first restaurant which became a massive success. We all
 were very deicated and hardworking and every customer was like a god to us. But once a very popular
 food vlogger came to our restaurant he liked our food and our restaurant went viral. Leading us to 
 think about expanding our business all over Uttar Pradesh and Delhi and then to other states of India.
 But we never expected our business to grow internationally so rapidly and we feel very happy about it.

 Our Aim is to get you highest quality products with the most fresh vegetables in the market, because we have 
 to ensure that you will get the finest taste of every food item in our menu, with any variation of any food 
 item you want will always be there. Although this menu is brief because only the most poular dishes are 
 mentioned our actual menu is huge. But the main point, there are more food items coming in the menu. So you
